# ⚙️ Oldham’s Coupling 

This repository features a detailed 3D CAD model of an **Oldham’s Coupling** — a flexible mechanical coupling used to connect two shafts that are slightly misaligned. The model was designed in **Autodesk Fusion 360** and is suitable for mechanical simulations, educational demonstrations, or rapid prototyping.

## 📌 What is Oldham's Coupling?

Oldham’s Coupling is used to transmit torque between two non-collinear shafts while accommodating **lateral (parallel) misalignment**. It consists of three main components:

- **Two end hubs** attached to the driving and driven shafts
- **A central floating disk** (intermediate member) with two perpendicular slots that slide into matching tongues on the hubs

This coupling is ideal for low- to medium-torque applications where shaft alignment isn't perfect.
